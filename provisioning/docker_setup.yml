# You can add users to the docker group to allow them to manage docker
# containers. This playbook uses sudo rather than the vagrant user because
# Ansible uses ControlPersist for SSH connections. The first time this playbook
# runs, the docker commands would fail if run by the vagrant user, since the
# persisted connection state isn't aware of the addition of the 'docker' group.
